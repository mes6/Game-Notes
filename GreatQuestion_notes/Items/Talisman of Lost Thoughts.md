Created from [[Memory Gems]], this talisman uses these gems to edit a person's memory with perfect control for up to 1 hour per day. 

Can only be used on people who have a memory gem in it's construction.

Once active, the wearer can target one or more of the talisman's subjects by directing their memories any way they wish during the next hour. The target must be within 100 ft and able to hear you.

As an action, may make a statement about the target(s) memory. 
You must speak to the target(s) to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. 


After the hour is over, a creature may make a Wisdom Save DC 25 to recognize something has been changed in their memories. If successful, they may make a second Wisdom Save, DC 20 to know what was changed. A success reveals what was altered along side a hazy memory of what actually happened.
