#backstory
From the once great nation of [Myr'Gah], Chession 'Chess' Dralley met Rothaniel '[[Rot]]' during the '[Princedom War]s' where they both enlisted to defend their hometown farming village in the [Misty Valley]. 

Returning home after a ?successful? campaign, the two were aghast to find that their home village had been destroyed to make room for an industrial #mining operation. Chess was enraged at being deigned their rightful 'hero's return' and opportunity to build a family in the homeland they had fought to defend. Scared both physically and emotionally after these repeated blows, Chess's mind began to warp with thoughts of vengeance and restitution.

At Chess's encouragement, [[Rot]] rallied forces and started a second campaign against his own Prince with Chess as his second in command.  The battles were hard and with many losses on both sides, but ultimately [[Rot]]'s forces were defeated. 

In a final desperate attempt to save their homelands and get vengeance for themselves, Chess sought out the Arch Fey [[Omitaomu]] and offered them 100 years of service if they would give [[Rot]] the power to *end* the [Princedom War]s and restore their homeland.

The 100 years passed in the #Feywilde (Unknown amount of time in Prime plane) and Chess returned to find a very different world than the hoped. [[Rot]] had been given to power to control the thoughts of every earth genasi, and could have used them to conquer all the princedoms in a single day! This power was made for restoring peace, not just to the [Misty Valley], but the entire country of [Myr'Gah]! But [[Rot]] did not have the conviction needed, and abandoned his task. 

This last devastation and perceived ultimate betrayal from [[Rot]] finally broke Chess's mind and on that day they became [[Dementia Malidict]].

Dementia vowed to do what [[Rot]] could not - they would use the power they bartered for and they would make sure that no one was ever capable of threatening their homeland again! They would make a family and a protector all in one swoop! With themselves as the leader of this new world order, all would cower and love [Nature's Aspirant]!
