## Backstory
Once a farming village in the [[Misty Valley]], [[Felicity Mills]] has long since been overrun by the ravages of war and industry. 
During the first [Princedom War], many brave genasi and eladrin volunteered to defend their homes (including [[Rot]]hanial and [Chess]). Although they returned victorious, a major deposit of rare crystalline Reminite (needed to make [[Memory Gems]]) had been found directly under the village center, so a mine was constructed - demolishing and taking over a third of what came to be called [Old Towne].

## Featured Locations

[Barracks]

[Old Towne]
has mine entrance?

[The Mourning Fields]
- Marked Graves before the first war
	- Well made decorative shrines to honor the fallen 
	- Colorful, but faded - Each shrine is made to resemble small doorways with a roof representing passage into the next life
- Marked Graves of the 1st Princedom war
	- Bronze lined plaques with name, rank, and allegiance placed on memorial walls
	- It is clear that most of the bodies did NOT make it home after the war and these memorials were placed in surrogate by the Prince after the war
- Graves After the 1st Princedom War
	- Workers Graves
		- Unremarkable slabs laid on the ground marked with a family crest 
		- Far too many are additionally marked with a waterfall flowing from cracked stone - representing the earth's tears on a child's grave
	- Mass Burn Pit
		- A hastily made large pit in the back edge of the Mourning Fields filled with burnt bones, armor, and animals that has nearly back filled with years of neglect - char marks and glass lines in the sand around it speak testament to the hellish temperatures that must have been reached here
		- This is where the 'rebel warriors' of the 2nd Princedom War were thrown and burnt. There is no official plaque or sign, but if the PCs investigate, they will find lots of hand written goodbyes and love poems to the lost 'heroes'
			- "May you find a safe home in the next life as you tried to give us one in this"
			- "Your fight was just in a world that can't be"
			-One note is painted in blood on a shield bearing a blacked and disfigured symbol of the Prince:
			- "Though you were felled to save me - It was I that failed you - Never again. ~General Warmaster Rothaniel"
			-On the back of the shield, facing the pit, is a second bloody note. This one written in different, more elegant handwriting
			- "Travel in Peace Brothers and Sisters - Lasting vengeance shall be yours ~ Chess "
